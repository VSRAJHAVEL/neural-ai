I already have a partially generated project in this Repl.
Do NOT start from scratch.
Your job is to finish and fix the whole app so it runs end-to-end.

Context:

Project name: Neural UI – AI-Powered Website Builder & Optimizer

Tech stack:

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js + Express

DB: Firebase (Auth + Firestore)

AI: free API (e.g., Groq or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint using my API key in .env)

✅ Your tasks (sprint):

Scan the existing project

Read all current files and folders (frontend + backend).

Identify anything incomplete, commented as TODO, placeholder, or obviously broken.

Do NOT delete working logic unless required to fix errors.

Complete missing pieces
Make sure I have all of these implemented and wired up:

A working backend with:

server.js (Express app)

Routes for:

POST /api/generate – takes layoutJson, calls the AI model, returns JSX + README (or similar)

POST /api/optimize – takes JSX, returns improved JSX + notes

AI client utility that uses an API key from .env (e.g. GROQ_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)

Proper JSON parsing of the AI response (no half-broken JSON).

A working frontend with:

Login page (Firebase email/password)

Builder page with:

Sidebar: add components like container, text, button, image, card, navbar

Canvas: show current layout, allow selecting a component

Properties panel: edit selected component props (like text, color, href, etc.)

Buttons:

“Save Project” → saves layout to Firestore

“Generate Code (AI)” → calls backend /api/generate with layout JSON

“Optimize Code (AI)” → calls backend /api/optimize with current JSX

Preview: renders a basic version of the layout

Wire frontend ↔ backend correctly

In the frontend API service, ensure the base URL points to the dev backend (e.g., http://localhost:5000 or the Replit host/port if needed).

Make sure all API calls match the backend routes and payloads.

Fix all runtime and build errors

Run the dev scripts you set up.

Fix import errors, missing exports, route path issues, or props issues.

Ensure npm install and then ONE dev command will start both frontend and backend (or clearly document separate commands).

Environment & config

Make sure I have a .env.example with all required keys (e.g., FIREBASE_…, API_BASE_URL, GROQ_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY).

Use environment variables for secrets; never hard-code keys in the frontend.

README

Create or update README.md with:

How to install

How to run locally in this Repl

What features work (login, builder, AI generate/optimize)

Where to put environment variables

Final check

After edits, make sure:

The project runs without crashing

I can:

Login / register

Open builder

Add some components

Save a project

Click “Generate Code (AI)” and get a non-empty result

If anything is stubbed or mocked (because I need real keys), clearly mark it with a comment.

When you’re done, list:

What you fixed

What you added

Any remaining steps I need to do (like adding real API keys or Firebase config).
